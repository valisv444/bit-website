        <h2>Why did i decide to join BIT and learn and study this?</h2>
        <p>
          Since a few years ago I started to be more interested in the world of
          computers and I knew and wanted to study and be in this world.
          Unfortunately I couldn't study the engineering I wanted, so I
          discovered BIT and it seemed to me an excellent option to study and
          continue.

      <section id="hear-About-bit">
        <h2>How did I hear about the BIT Institute?</h2>
        <p>While researching to study, after knowing that I was not going to be able to study the engineering I wanted, I came across BIT and it was the best option I found.</p>

      <section id="experience">
        <h2>My experience</h2>
        <p>I don't really have much experience in this. So I'm starting out knowing almost nothing, but my knowledge keeps expanding and I learn a lot every time I study. And I can really see the content that  to learn if I need something that we haven't seen it in class.</p>

      <section id="expectations">
        <h2>Expectations</h2>
        <p>To leave here being a developer with all the necessary knowledge to continue learning and working much more in this world.</p>

      <section id="my-Study-method">
        <h2>My study method</h2>
        <p>I'm really a person who listens and pays attention to what is being explained to me and then puts it into practice. Maybe that's why I don't really talk at all in class because I prefer to concentrate on what I understand and once I understand, I put it into practice right away. That's why I haven't really had any problems nor do I go to the teacher for help, because the explanation is clear and concise and I proceed to write it down, understand and put it into practice. That's what helps me to learn everything correctly.</p>
