     <h2>What are my interests?</h2>
     <p>I have varied interests. I'm starting to enjoy researching theatre, but especially experimental and strange plays. I like the whole aesthetic of experimental theatre too, it can be weird but it's enjoyable and very interesting. It's definitely not for everyone though. I also like cinema a lot, all kinds of movies so some days I like to watch them a lot. I like to read a lot, everything I can get my hands on. I like to research and inform myself on the subject I'm interested in and I like to appreciate art through images created by other people, it gives me a lot of inspiration. I also have the goal to review and learn various concepts in mathematics on my own and to improve my mathematical knowledge too much. </p>

     <h3>Recipe for my favourite food, french fries</h3>
     <ol>
         <li>You must first wash your potatoes. It is important to remove all the dirt impregnated in the skin of your potatoes </li>
        <li>peel the potatoes and cut them into thin strips.</li>
        <li>if you want them crispier, soak them in cold water for 30 minutes before frying.</li>
        <li>heat the oil in the fryer before putting the potatoes in.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes in the fryer for as long as it takes for them to fry properly and become crispy and golden brown. Check them regularly</li>
        <li>Once your potatoes are fried, take them out of the oil and place them on an absorbent napkin so that any excess oil runs off and your potatoes are not too greasy.</li>
        <li>Add salt and seasoning to taste, such as paprika or pepper. Serve with your favourite sauce.</li>
     </ol>
