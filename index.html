     <h2>Information about me</h2>

     <img src="./assets/stars-photo.jpg" alt="photo about some branches of a tree with stars on it">

     <p>I'm a rather calm, quiet and introverted person. I was born on the 27th of July 2005, so I'm currently 19 years old. I have lived all my life in Bogot√°, where I was born and where I still live.

      I currently live alone with my grandmother, who has been a very important part of my life. My environment is simple, but this has given me the space to focus on my interests and grow in my own way.</p>

     <h2>My experience</h2>

     <img src="./assets/fairy-photo.jpg" alt="photo about fairies">

     <p>I really don't have any experience in this area. I have never worked as a web developer or programmer. My goal was to study computer engineering, but due to economic issues I couldn't do it, but I found BIT Institute and it was the best option for me at the moment.</p>
