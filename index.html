        <section id="Reasons-to-join-git">
        <h2>why did i decide to join BIT and learn and study this?</h2>  
        <p>Since a few years ago I started to be more interested in the world of computers and I knew I wanted to study and be in this world. Unfortunately I couldn't study the engineering I wanted, so I discovered BIT and it seemed to me an excellent option to study and continue.</p>

         <h2>My interests</h2>
         <p>Apart from learning to program, I like books, music, movies, I am trying to learn mathematics in a self-taught way to improve notably in that area, I like to investigate on various topics and I like to appreciate the art and aesthetics of the people who create, I get inspiration from there.</p>

        <section id="My-study-method">
            <h2>My study method</h2>
            <p>I'm really a person who listens and pays attention to what is being explained to me and then puts it into practice. Maybe that's why I don't really talk at all in class because I prefer to concentrate on what I understand and once I understand, I put it into practice right away. That's why I haven't really had any problems nor do I go to the teacher for help, because the explanation is clear and concise and I proceed to write it down, understand and put it into practice. That's what helps me to learn everything correctly.</p>
